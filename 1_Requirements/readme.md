INTRODUCTION:

         
         Visual impairment is a condition that affects many people around the world. There are a wide range of navigation systems and tools existing for the blind to navigate quickly and safely against obstacles and other hazards faced, but very few of them have proved efficient. This project is is to develop an embedded reliable automated device using sensors and helps to guide the blind people where the obstacle along their path and help them moving with fewer accident.
          
            
            
            
FEATURES:



By wearing this device they can fully avoid the use of white cane and such other devices.


This device will help the blind to navigate without holding a stick which is a bit annoying for them.


They can simply wear it as a band or cloth and it can function very accurately and they only need a very little training to use it.







COST:




The system is much more efficient and reliable and economically cheap compared to the existing systems.





SWOT ANALYSIS:





Strenght:



By using this device blind person to move around and go from one place to another.




Weakness:



Cannot be carried easily, needs a lot of training to useâ€¦





Opportunities:

 
 
 Helps the blinds people to navigate with speed and confidence.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Threat:



In somecase  sensor are unable to detect the objects.




4 W's and 1H:





WHO:



This devices can be used by blind people.





WHEN:



To detect the object infront of the blind people and  also it will notify through speaker






WHAT:


Help to guide the blind people and to move safely.






WHERE:




To guide the blind people whenever they go outside.






How:
 


Sensors used in this project it will guide the blind people to move safely.
